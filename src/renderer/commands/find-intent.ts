// A one-slot "open Find as soon as there's a canvas showing THIS document".
//
// `CanvasServices` only exist while WorkspaceCanvasView is mounted, i.e. while a
// DOCUMENT tab is focused. A command that focuses a doc tab and then wants Find
// cannot simply call `find.open()` afterwards: the dispatch only SCHEDULES the
// tab change, so the canvas stays unmounted for the rest of that synchronous run
// and `ctx.canvas` is null. That was a live bug — `tools.open.ocr` was
// a dead click, and its test passed only because the test pre-registered
// services, a precondition that cannot hold at the tool's real entry point (the
// Tools tab, where the canvas is by definition not mounted).
//
// So park the intent and let the mount drain it — the same park-then-flush shape
// cross-document find jumps use.
//
// The park is KEYED TO ITS TARGET, and the drain checks that the canvas which
// mounted is showing that target. A bare boolean would fire on whatever canvas
// mounted next: park for a.pdf, change your mind, open b.pdf an hour later, and
// Find springs open there for no reason the user can see. The first draft
// documented "callers must guarantee a doc tab lands" as the mitigation — but an
// invariant that depends on future writers remembering is one that will break
// (a lesson the cross-document jump and the activeToolId fix already paid
// for), so the module enforces it rather than asking.
//
// This lives in its own module rather than in `context.ts` because `context`
// imports `COMMANDS` from `registry`, and `registry` is what needs to request a
// find — routing it through context would close an import cycle.
