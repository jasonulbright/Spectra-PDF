 * A programmatic jump's intent, recorded by `centerOn`.
 *
 * Scroll position ALONE is ambiguous at the scroll extremes and cannot be made
 * unambiguous by any formula: "scrolled to the top" and "jumped to page 2 of a
 * pane showing pages 1-3" are the SAME scrollTop (centring page 2 wants a
 * negative offset, so it clamps to 0), yet must report 1 and 2 respectively.
 * Same at the end: jumping to page 49 of 50 saturates at maxScroll, which is
 * also where "scrolled to the bottom" (page 50) lands. So a jump records what
 * it MEANT, and that wins until the user scrolls away from it — which is how
 * the page box stops snapping back (regression, twice: first the tie-break,
 * then the boundary clamps that "fixed" it).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY BEST-EFFORT, and it fails SAFE: any reindex drops it. As shipped,
 * nothing about a page survives one — `lib/workspace.ts` re-derives every
 * PageRef from the new buffer and assigns BOTH `id` and `sourcePageIndex`
 * positionally. (`PageRef.id`'s "stable" only ever meant "survives a REORDER",
 * where the live reducers carry the same objects through.)
 *
 * For an engine-authored or external reindex that is also IRREDUCIBLE: the
 * renderer didn't author those bytes, so position can't be trusted (a reopened,
 * externally-edited file can re-compose the doc while scroll/zoom/pane all stay
 * equal) and content-fingerprint matching is the identity-model surgery
 * `18-phase3-polish.md` weighed and declined.
 *
 * For the JS page-tier COMMIT it is a COST decision, not an impossibility — be
 * honest about which (regression: the first draft of this note conflated
 * them). `workspace-commit.ts` `planCommit` builds the new file FROM the
 * pre-commit `PageRef[]`, 1:1 and in order, so the app does know the old-id →
 * new-position mapping at that moment; `COMMIT_PAGE_EDITS` simply doesn't carry
 * it, leaving identity to the blind positional formula. Threading it through is
 * bounded but lands page-identity plumbing in the most invariant-dense path in
 * the app (atomic multi-file commit, single in-flight run, the commit gate) and
 * would still need width/height + rotation reconciliation for baked rotations —
 * a poor trade for remembering ONE page-number readout. So: not done, and the
 * cost is bounded — a jump to a boundary-ADJACENT page (2, or N-1) stops being
 * remembered once you Save, and `currentPageFor`'s at-top/at-end answer takes
 * over. Revisit if a second consumer ever needs cross-commit page identity.
