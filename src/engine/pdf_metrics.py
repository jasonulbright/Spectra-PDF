# in otherwise-renderable text must not crash/refuse the whole value). Covers

# The separators are ESCAPES on purpose. They were LITERAL U+2028/U+2029
# here until 2026-07-29: invisible in an editor, indistinguishable from
# spaces, and one whitespace-normalising edit away from vanishing with no
# visible diff. The compiled character classes are unchanged -- verified
# identical across U+0000..U+2FFF when the escapes went in.
#
# CodeQL reports py/overly-large-range on the second range. It is a FALSE
# POSITIVE, and the range is exact rather than sloppy: C0 runs \x00-\x1f, so
# excluding ONLY \x0a (newline) necessarily leaves \x00-\x09 plus \x0b-\x1f.
# CR (\x0d) is inside that range deliberately -- flatten_control_chars
# below normalises CRLF and CR to LF BEFORE substituting, so no CR ever
# reaches the regex and keep_newline genuinely preserves newlines.
