"""Page-image editing (Phase 7.1 — the first Edit slice).

Lists, deletes, replaces, and extracts IMAGE XObject placements on a page.
A "placement" is one `Do` draw of an image — the unit the user clicks. Ids
are the depth-first visit order of image draws (page stream first, forms
recursed at their `Do` position), so the lister and the rewriter agree by
construction: both walk in encounter order.

Edit semantics are strictly PER-PLACEMENT:
  - delete removes that one `Do`; a shared image XObject drawn elsewhere is
    untouched. Reachability cleanup is `_finalize_page_rewrite` (the
    redact.py recipe): qpdf's `remove_unreferenced_resources` GC plus an
    explicit drop of superseded original FORMS (which the GC leaves) — so
    deleted/replaced image bytes are genuinely absent from the output, not
    merely undrawn.
  - replace registers the new image under a NEW name and renames only that
    `Do` — other placements of the original keep the original. The
    placement CTM is preserved exactly: the new image draws into the old
    box (a different aspect ratio stretches; that is the documented v1
    behavior, matching the phase doc's "reuse the original placement CTM").
  - a placement INSIDE a Form XObject is edited on a COPY of that form
    (registered under a fresh name, only that draw's `Do` rewritten) — the
    `_redact_form` copy-on-edit pattern — so a form stamped on ten pages
    changes only where the user edited it.

Replacement sources (no new engine deps — the WEBVIEW is the decoder, this
module only embeds):
  - ``{"jpeg_path": ...}``: byte passthrough as /DCTDecode (zero quality
    loss). Grayscale and RGB JPEGs only; anything else (CMYK/progressive
    oddities the SOF scan can't bless) raises a specific error the renderer
    answers by re-sending decoded raw pixels.
  - ``{"raw_path": ..., "width": w, "height": h, "channels": 3|4}``: packed
    8-bit pixels from the renderer's canvas decode. channels=4 splits the
    alpha plane into an /SMask.

Inline images (BI/ID/EI) are placements too (9.C4 re-ratified the 7.1
non-goal): they list with `kind: "inline"` in the same depth-first id
order as XObject draws (`kind: "xobject"`), and the wrap/drop family
(delete/transform/crop/opacity) applies to them identically — both draw
the unit square under the live CTM. REPLACE and EXTRACT refuse inline
targets with named reasons (delete + add covers the workflow; the bytes
live in the stream, so a deleted inline draw needs no GC).

Text-run editing (7.2) will consolidate this walker and redact.py's into
one shared interpreter; for this slice the graphics-state tracking is
deliberately duplicated (~40 lines, helpers imported) rather than churning
the security-critical redactor in a release-bound slice — see
docs/architecture/21-phase7-content-editing.md.

    the clip is unit-space, so the innermost slot is the only one that
