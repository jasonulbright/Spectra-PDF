"""Export a PDF to an editable Office / web format via LibreOffice headless (O1).

LibreOffice is bundled and invoked as an isolated subprocess (the Ghostscript
model — unmodified upstream, redistributed under MPL-2.0; see
THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md § LibreOffice). It is never linked into this app's code.

Import quirk that shapes this module: LibreOffice imports EVERY PDF as a **Draw**
document. Draw exports cleanly to web/vector/image targets (HTML, XHTML), but the
Writer word-processing filters (.docx/.rtf/.odt) cannot write a Draw document —
`soffice --convert-to docx` on a PDF fails at the write step ("SfxBaseModel::
impl_store … 0xc10"). So Writer targets go through a two-step bridge: PDF → HTML
(Draw's own export, which carries the real text) → the Writer format (Writer opens
the HTML and saves it out). The bridge preserves editable text — verified: a
born-digital PDF's sentences come back as real ``<w:t>`` runs, not a page image.

Each call uses a FRESH, throwaway user-profile directory: a headless soffice
refuses to start a second instance against a profile another soffice (e.g. the
user's open GUI copy) already holds, and would silently hang. The profile and any
bridge temp are cleaned up in a finally.
