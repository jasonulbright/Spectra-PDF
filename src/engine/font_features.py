"""OpenType feature control (small caps, alternates).

Applies GSUB features to text WE lay out, at the glyph level. Because our
embedding is Type0/Identity (CID == GID, controlled by us), we can draw any
glyph the font contains while keeping ToUnicode pointed at the original
characters — so feature-styled text stays searchable and re-editable.

SCOPE — only NON-CONTEXTUAL features, applied without a shaper:
  - small caps: `smcp` (lowercase -> small cap) + `c2sc` (uppercase -> small
    cap), applied together so "Abc" becomes uniform small caps.
  - alternates: `salt` (stylistic alternates) — a glyph may offer several;
    the caller picks one by index (default 0 = the first alternate).
A single substitution (LookupType 1) and an alternate substitution
(LookupType 3) are both context-free 1->1 (alternate = 1->pick-1) maps, so a
plain table read is CORRECT here — no HarfBuzz needed. Ligatures (`liga`) and
contextual features are deliberately NOT applied: they need a shaping engine,
and a partial hand-rolled shaper would style some sequences and silently miss
others (the silent-partial class).

SOURCE — a feature applies from whichever font already carries it: a document
set in a font with `smcp` gets real small
caps from its own font. When the current font lacks the feature the caller
requires an explicit switch to a bundled face that has it (Libertinus Serif).
