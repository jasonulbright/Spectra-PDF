"""Embedded file attachments — the /EmbeddedFiles name tree.

PDF documents can carry attached files, such as a spreadsheet beside its report
or a source file beside its export. They live in the catalog's /Names
/EmbeddedFiles name tree; pikepdf exposes them as `pdf.attachments`. This module
lists, adds, extracts, and removes them — a name-tree editor, like the AcroJS
and page-labels editors.
