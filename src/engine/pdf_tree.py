"""Shared page-tree helpers.

Several page attributes (/Resources, /Rotate, /MediaBox, /CropBox) are
inheritable per the PDF spec: a page dict lacking its own entry takes it
from the nearest ancestor /Pages node that has one — common output from
generators that hoist a single shared dict onto the tree rather than
duplicating it per page. ``page.obj.get`` alone only ever sees the page's
OWN dict, which silently misreads such files (an inherited /Resources is a
redaction false negative; watermark needs the same walk for /Rotate and the
boxes). One implementation here so a future fix propagates to every consumer.
