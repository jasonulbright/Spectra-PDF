"""Digital signatures: verification AND signing.

Verification (``verify_signatures``) reports, per embedded signature: whether
it's cryptographically valid, whether the bytes it covers are intact, whether
the document was modified after signing (coverage level), the signer's
certificate identity, and the claimed signing time.

Verification scope — deliberately "single-cert" (roadmap § C): we validate
the signature's cryptography and the document's integrity, but do NOT
validate the signer's certificate against any trust store, nor check
revocation, nor timestamp/LTV. So ``trusted`` is reported but is
DETERMINISTICALLY False — the UI must present a valid result as
"cryptographically valid, signer identity NOT verified against a trusted
authority", never as fully trusted. PAdES/LTV/TSA remain owner-locked out of
v1 (arm's-length AGPL subprocess is the documented future path). See
docs/architecture/10-phase2h-signatures.md.

Signing (``sign_pdf``) is shipped — Phase 2h signing + Phase 2k completeness:
signer sources are a .pfx/.p12 (``_load_signer_from_pfx``) or a PEM key +
certificate pair with key-match validation (``_load_signer_from_pem``);
placement is invisible, a visible stamp rect, or an existing empty signature
field (``--existing-field`` / sign-into-field); ``generate_signer`` creates
an in-app self-signed identity. See docs/architecture/11-phase2h-signing.md
and 13-phase2k-signature-completeness.md.

CRITICAL — trust context: we pass an EXPLICIT EMPTY trust context
(``ValidationContext(trust_roots=[])``), NOT ``signer_validation_context=None``.
Passing None does NOT mean "no anchor": pyHanko's SimpleTrustManager.build
treats ``trust_roots is None`` as "load the operating system's certificate
store" (oscrypto `trust_list.get_list()` — ~dozens of real CA roots on
Windows). Under None, a PDF signed by any commercial CA (DigiCert, GlobalSign,
…) would come back ``trusted=True``, machine-dependent, silently contradicting
this slice's whole promise. An explicit empty ``trust_roots=[]`` (a non-None
value, so no OS fallback) makes ``trusted`` deterministically False regardless
of the host's trust store. Regression-tested by monkeypatching the OS store to
contain the signer cert and asserting ``trusted`` stays False.

Uses pyHanko (MIT) — the ByteRange / CMS / incremental-update handling is
exactly the security-critical plumbing not to hand-roll.

    string for an unencrypted PEM key).

    Appearance: by default the signature is INVISIBLE. Passing ``appearance``
    = ``{page: <1-based>, rect: [x0,y0,x1,y1]}`` (PDF user-space points,
    bottom-up — the same convention as redaction regions) draws a visible
    stamp (signer, signing time, optional reason/location) at that box in a
    NEW signature field.

    Existing field (2n.4d): passing ``existing_field`` instead FILLS the
    named, already-present, EMPTY signature field — the field's own widget
    /Rect provides the stamp box (a zero-size widget signs invisibly, which
    is that field's design). Mutually exclusive with ``appearance`` (each
    decides the placement); refuses (before any signing work) when the field
    is missing, not a signature field, or already signed.

    SECURITY: the ``password`` is used only to load the signer and is NEVER
    placed in the return value, an error message, or any log. The result is
    self-verified via verify_signatures so the caller gets immediate
    confirmation.

    Args:
        file: Input PDF path.
        output: Output path for the signed PDF; may equal ``file`` (in place).
        pfx_path: PKCS#12 (.pfx/.p12) signer file.
        password: Passphrase for the signer (empty string if none).
        field_name: NEW signature field name (default "Signature1"); ignored
            when ``existing_field`` is given.
        reason / location: Optional signature metadata (not secret).
        key_path / cert_path: PEM/DER signer files (alternative to pfx_path).
        appearance: Optional visible-stamp placement (see above).
        existing_field: Name of an existing empty signature field to fill.
