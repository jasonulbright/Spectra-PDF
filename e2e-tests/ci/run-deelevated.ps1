# Runs a command NON-ELEVATED (Medium integrity) from an elevated CI step.
#
# Why this exists: CI runners execute jobs elevated, but WebView2's DevTools
# debugging endpoint is gated for elevated host processes on current runtimes
# (the v150 trusted-origin check — MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback#5640), so
# WebDriver sessions against the app can only be created from a de-elevated
# process — which is also how end users actually run the app.
#
# Mechanism: a SAFER "Basic User" restricted token via `runas /trustlevel`
# (Secondary Logon). A scheduled task with -RunLevel Limited was tried first
# and did NOT de-elevate on the runner image — consistent with the image
# running UAC-disabled, where an admin user has no filtered token and
# "Limited" is a no-op. SAFER tokens drop the Administrators group and set
# Medium IL regardless of UAC state. The child prints its own token's
# integrity level into the log (TOKEN-IL line) so every run PROVES the level
# it executed at instead of assuming it.
#
# The child does not reliably inherit the step's environment, so PATH is
# baked into a generated inner script; output is written to a file and
# replayed into the step log; the inner exit code is propagated.
