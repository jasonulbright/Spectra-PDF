# Regenerates src-tauri/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES-RUST.html -- the per-crate
# license and notice listing for every Rust crate compiled into the app
# binary, produced by cargo-about from the exact Cargo.lock graph and shipped
# as a bundle resource (tauri.conf.json maps it into the app's resources).
# Run after any dependency change in src-tauri; commit the regenerated file.
#
# cargo-about is a BUILD-TIME tool (installed into ~/.cargo/bin), never
# vendored into the product. about.toml holds the accepted-license list; a
# crate under a license outside that list fails generation LOUDLY so it gets
# reviewed instead of shipped without notices.
#
# ASCII ONLY in this file: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less UTF-8 as
# ANSI and a multi-byte character can mangle into a parser-breaking byte.
